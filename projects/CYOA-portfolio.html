            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p> In this project, I used various processes to create an interactive storyline with my partner. The primary goal was to practice implementing patterns which connect links, files, and directories. </p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p> My partner and I were able to formulate a functioning story game using connceting features like the prompt proposed. The basis of our story consists of a magical forest with a concentrating suspense from a mysterious creature. Through planning (google drawing diagram which can be found on the project page), constant communication (via slack), driver and navigator methods (the roles we switched between to execute certain git commands), and git commands (git push, pull, commit, etc.), we were able to nurture the concept of our project</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Challenges: During my fall semester, we learned about topics pertaining to my IDE (integrated development environment) which I had to rely heavily on during this project. However, I was behind on most of these topics in terms of homework, summative assessments, projects, etc. In turn, I found it difficult to find a good starting point. </p>
            <p> Takeaways: Eventually, I had to start somewhere so I decided to use past sources to catch myself up to most of the topics which I had struggled with. This included learning the purpose of different git commands as these were the primary factors to the functionality of the storyline. To further incorporate functionality, I also had to learn to input links. For this, I used my previous restaurant guide practice to create the links. Lastly, I had to learn how to perform collaborative work as this was a significant component of the project. I had to particularly work on push and pull commands with my partner as well as establishing a navigator and driver system to confirm our individual roles in the making of this project. Through this entire process of relearning topics, I now understand the importance of dependence and having to sometimes prioritize one's reliance on another, and vice verca, in order to complete individual parts efficiently. </p>
            <p> Next steps: I plan to continue working on my time management to avoid having to repeat time consuming processes which could harm my ability to fully understand new topics. Essentially, I want to move past my past. </p>
