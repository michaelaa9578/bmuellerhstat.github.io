            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p> In this project, I used various processes to create an interactive storyline with my partner. The primary goal was to practice implementing patterns which connect links, files, and directories. </p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p> My partner and I were able to formulate a functioning story game using connceting features like the prompt proposed. The basis of our story consists of a magical forest with a concentrating suspense from a mysterious creature. Through planning (google drawing diagram which can be found on the project page), constant communication (via slack), driver and navigator methods (the roles we switched between to execute certain git commands), and git commands (git push, pull, commit, etc.), we were able to nurture the concept of our project</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Challenges: When not knowing a subject, I would rely on my partner to complete the task in question, and vice versa. For example, for a majority of the project I was unable to properly use divs and spans. Hence, I constantly depended on my partner to complete those particular sections which only limited my knowledge and left me confused when it came to applying other topics. </p>
            <p> Takeaways: Experiencing the struggle of being lost on numerous sections of the project, I was eventually forced to research them. Studying certain subjects to a greater extent helped me recognize faults in the code and led to an ultimate solution. The research not only provided answers but was also able to open up the discussion of new properties to further sophisticate my project. By learning more about divs, I was able to begin using spans as well being that both tools were used in styling. </p>
            <p> Next steps: I wish to continue working on recognizing my mistakes as it guarantees improvement in other areas. The same type of problem solving is essential in the real world which is what makes recognition greatly significant. </p>
