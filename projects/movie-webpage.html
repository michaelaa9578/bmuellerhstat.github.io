            <h2> Context </h2>
            <p> In this project, I used various css and html properties to collaboratively create a movie advertisement. The primary goal was to utilize most of the factors we learned in class including CSS and HTML properties to create a functional project. </p>
            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p> With what we acquired in class, my partner and I were able to form a proper movie advertisement like the prompt proposed. The plot of our action thriller incorporates two protagonists who undergo aerial warfare. To build suspense, the reason to their rivalry is unknown. Taking advantage of the formed suspense, my partner and I revolved a majority of the advertisement around the rivalry in question. With the use of headings, paragraphs, divs, spans, fonts, and a variety of other inputs, we were able to prolong the given suspense which fueled the concept of our project.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Challenges: When not knowing a subject, I would rely on my partner to complete the task in question, and vice versa. For example, for a majority of the project I was unable to properly use divs and spans. Hence, I constantly depended on my partner to complete those particular sections which only limited my knowledge and left me confused when it came to applying other topics. </p>
            <p> Takeaways: Experiencing the struggle of being lost on numerous sections of the project, I was eventually forced to research them. Studying certain subjects to a greater extent helped me recognize faults in the code and led to an ultimate solution. The research not only provided answers but was also able to open up the discussion of new properties to further sophisticate my project. By learning more about divs, I was able to begin using spans as well being that both tools were used in styling. </p>
            <p> Next steps: </p>
